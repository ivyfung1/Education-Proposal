# Proposal for NEM Education

## Executive Summary

This syllabus was initially created to train developers. Its objectives is to answer the question many people asked, `"Where to start?"`. There are a lot of information about how to set up nodes, how to use APIs, and how to use SDKs, yet, many still ask, `“How do I start?” ` 

There are a small bunch of developers whom we came across who do know how to do that or have already built an application on NEM Blockchain. However, the integration would be more effective and efficient if the understanding of NEM Blockchain's features and the implementations of SDKs, wrappers and APIs etc. were being better understood. Case in view, a project has created mosaics with no divisibility. They need 108 billions of mosaics to represent the amount of ICO fund they had raised. Knowing the characteristics of the 5 features would have helped in designing a better architecture for the application.  

With the demand from universities to offer Blockchain courses, the syllabus was expanded to fit into academia’s requirements. The modules can be customised to fit into different faculties, different group of audience and duration of trainings.  

Currently, we are answering to the needs of the universities on an ad hoc basis. A better planning and execution would be helpful to push the syllabus for a wider adoption. This is not only to fully capitalise on the syllabus created, it is also to help in the mass adoption of NEM when it is known to more people, starting from the education institutes.  

The main benefits of promoting NEM Blockchain syllabus to the education institutes are:
1. Early exposure for students to NEM Blockchain.
2. Fill the gap of demand and supply for blockchain developers.
3. Help in promoting mass adoption of NEM.  

The aforementioned objectives can be achieved with the following issues being tackled:
1. Proper planning of manpower for syllabus development, marketing and training.
2. Keeping close proximity with the development of the NEM technology.
3. Recognition and certification from NEM Foundation for those have been trained.  

Currently, the syllabus is focusing in technical modules, for both undergraduate and graduate schools. Business analysis, tokenomic, marketing and management related modules will be introduced as we have received requests for such modules. In addition, it is in the planning to work with research labs in the universities for more use cases and other blockchain related researches.  

Education will not be the only profit-generating unit, it will also directly or indirectly help generate incomes from certification and memberships, and trainings.
Before diving in, it is always good to do an audit internally and externally.

## Strengths
• Ready modular syllabus that is customisable.  
• Trial run starting in January 2019 with 2 universities in Manila.  
• Another 9 education institutes will be working with NEM PH to offer blockchain syllabus in 2019. Amongst all, we have the top universities in Philippines partnering with NEM PH.  
• NEM technology makes it easier to be incorporated in university’s syllabus as compare
to others.    

## Weaknesses
• Lack of manpower: assistant writer and trainers that able to train the trainers.  
• Lack of proper planning and integration within departments.   

## Opportunities
• More demand for blockchain developers than supply.  
• Certifications of developers, business partners and education partners.  
• No other blockchain has ready syllabus for universities.  
• Students who graduating will be garnered with NEM Blockchain technology’s knowledge hence become the influencers to start-ups and enterprises.  
• Mass adoption of NEM with more influencers and developers around.  
• More opportunities of R&D in academia.  

## Threats
• Other blockchain platforms might be coming up with syllabus for universities and certifications for developers.  
• Too slow to mass adoption.   

## Objectives
The purposes of this proposal for education unit are to bring along the changes in the perception towards blockchain, to answer to the demand of developers and to make NEM a household brand. To breakdown to smaller objectives, it aims:  
1. To promote blockchain and NEM.  
2. To produce developers and professionals to fill the demand gap.  
3. To aid mass adoption.  
4. To be able to engage more educational institutes more effectively.  
5. To gather more use cases.  
6. To bring in more research and development partners.  
7. To scout for talents.   

## Key Result Areas
There are few areas that are critical in order for the plan to be successfully executed. They are interconnecting and failing in achieving any of those areas might bring a ripple effect.  

1. Continuous improving and updating the syllabus. Being updated with the progress of NEM technology is of utmost importance in order to be able to provide the most update information in the syllabus. Hence, education needs to be keep up-to-date with technical teams.  
2. Refresher training for trainers in universities.  
3. Effective marketing team.  
4. Trainers will need to be able to train the trainers rather than just training about the
knowledge.  
5. Feedback from education institutes is important for understanding the needs of
different faculty for improvement.  
6. Actual use cases are important to convince education institutes that NEM is a good
platform to be introduced in university courses, especially when more of other
Blockchains gaining their traction.  
7. It is always about supply and demand. When there are demands in the market, there
will be the needs for supply.  
8. Certification for qualified individuals and institutes.  
9. Customised the syllabus to different university and faculty. The standard of each
university is different and each faculty has their own focuses, being able to answer to their needs is important for the buy-in.

## Key Performance Indicators
Target is always good to be specific, measurable, achievable yet difficult enough, and timed. Main targets that we are looking at are as followed: (Please refer to the document in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yOp5FcOJaX-qtKiPBygxTGw9p2RzDX9D) to look at previous proposal done in 2018.)

1. Number of universities onboarding in a year. The target is set based on interested parties that have reached out to us.

2. Number of system integrators (SI) and corporate partners onboarding in a year. Target on onboarding system integrators and corporate partners is going modest as this sector has grown slower than education and to have enough workforce for the SI and corporates, churning out supply to the workforce would be considered as solving both problems in one go. Aligning the plan with business development would be able to pump up the figure.
  
3. Number of extra faculty signed up in a year. Currently, only one faculty is signing up to offer blockchain course with NEM. Aiming to expand one more faculty each year in all the university offering NEM blockchain syllabus.

4. New/updated modules per year. New modules are aiming to fit into university’s syllabus requirements.
  
5. Number of research and development projects from the universities. Targeting to nurture at least one good use case per university per year.

6. Number of certified members in a year. As this target would be dependable on the membership fee agreed by foundation and also the promotion of it. Hence, it is better off to be a shared target with other units rather than an education unit’s.

## Scheduling

1. First quarter of 2019  
*a. Syllabus for Catapult
